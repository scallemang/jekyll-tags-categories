# jekyll-tags-categories
A default Jekyll installation, except with tags and categories designed to work with GitHub pages.

## How to Use

1. All categories and tags must be configured in the appropriate YAML file in _data.
2. All categories and tags must have their own page. Look at jekyll.md, update.md, examplecategory.md and/or exampletag.md for examples.

## N.B.

I tried to keep this as close to &lsquo;out-of-the-box&rsquo; Jekyll as possible. That said, I added category and tag metadata to the bottom of the post.html layout, and styled the blog_by_category and blog_by_tag layouts in a way I thought was consistent with the default set-up.

You may wish to link to category pages in the menu, or have the categories in a post link to their respective pages. I didn&rsquo;t want to make those decisions for youâ€”this is a bare minimum set-up to have category and tag pages on GitHub pages, but you&rsquo;re implementation will be up to you.

Best wishes!
